                    <h2>Understanding Tire Types</h2>
                    <p>Tires are designed for different driving conditions, and choosing the right type can greatly impact your vehicle’s performance. Here’s a breakdown of common tire types:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>All-Terrain Tires:</b> Perfect for those who need a balance of off-road durability and on-road comfort. These tires provide strong traction on gravel, dirt, and paved roads.</li>
                        <li><b>Mud-Terrain Tires:</b> Built for extreme off-roading. These tires have aggressive tread patterns that excel in muddy and rocky terrains but may produce more road noise on highways.</li>
                        <li><b>Highway Tires:</b> Designed for smooth rides and fuel efficiency. Ideal for daily commuters and those who prioritize comfort over rugged performance.</li>
                        <li><b>Winter Tires:</b> Essential for cold-weather conditions, these tires offer better traction in snow and ice, reducing the risk of slipping.</li>
                        <li><b>Performance Tires:</b> Engineered for sports cars and high-speed handling, offering excellent grip and responsiveness.</li>
                    </ul>

                <h2>When to Replace Your Tires</h2>
                <p>Knowing when to replace your tires can save you from unexpected breakdowns and accidents. Here are some signs that it’s time for a new set:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Tread Wear:</b> If your tires have less than 2/32 of an inch of tread depth, they need to be replaced. A quick way to check is the penny test—insert a penny into the tread with Lincoln’s head facing down. If you can see the top of his head, it’s time for new tires.</li>
                    <li><b>Cracks or Bulges:</b> Visible damage on the sidewalls can indicate weakening, which increases the risk of a blowout.</li>
                    <li><b>Vibration or Pulling:</b> If your vehicle vibrates excessively or pulls to one side, your tires may be worn unevenly or improperly balanced.</li>
                    <li><b>Age:</b> Even if your tires look fine, rubber degrades over time. If your tires are more than six years old, it’s a good idea to have them inspected by professionals.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Tire Maintenance Tips</h2>
                <p>Getting the most out of your tires means taking care of them. Here are some simple maintenance tips to help extend their lifespan:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Check Tire Pressure Regularly:</b> Underinflated or overinflated tires wear out faster and reduce fuel efficiency. We recommend checking your tire pressure at least once a month.</li>
                    <li><b>Rotate Your Tires:</b> Rotating your tires every 5,000-7,500 miles promotes even wear and prolongs their lifespan.</li>
                    <li><b>Balance and Align Your Tires:</b> Proper alignment ensures even tread wear and better handling. If you notice your car pulling to one side, it may be time for an alignment check.</li>
                    <li><b>Avoid Overloading Your Vehicle:</b> Carrying too much weight puts extra stress on your tires, leading to premature wear.</li>
                    <li><b>Inspect for Damage:</b> Regularly check for cuts, punctures, or embedded objects that could lead to slow leaks.</li>
                </ul>
